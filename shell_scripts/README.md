This folder contains pre-written shell_scripts for all the models we used for final submission. The shell scripts are based
on Google Cloud AI Platform, and we also highly recommend you run the model on the cloud due to the large dataset size. However, 
if you want to run it locally, you can refer to the homepage instruction for locally runable script.
